# CNN
(Convolutional Neural Network)
Python CNN Machine Learning Model

This is the first version of my CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model. It runs at a 85-90% accuracy with the current dataset that is imported. Feel free to improve/fork/report issues.

I plan on continouts work on this realease an updated version in the future but exact date is yet to be determined.

Use cases

To perform an examination of dataset passed through the CNN, and predict results on Training test.
